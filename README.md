# ‚ö° SmartGrid-BigData-Analytics

This project applies **machine learning** and **data analytics** to **forecast power load in a smart grid** environment. It uses historical time-series data to train predictive models, enabling energy providers to anticipate demand more accurately and optimize grid performance.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file (`smart_grid_load.csv`) located in the `data/` folder, and includes:

- `Datetime`: timestamp (hourly)
- `Load`: electrical load value (float)

> Make sure the file has no missing `Datetime` values and is sorted chronologically.
